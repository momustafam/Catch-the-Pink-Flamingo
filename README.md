## Overview
The **Catch the Pink Flamingo** is the final project for the **Big Data Specialization** offered by the **University of San Diego**. This project is designed to apply big data techniques, including data exploration, classification, clustering, and graph analytics, to a simulated game dataset using Splunk, KNIME, Apache Spark, and Neo4j.

## Project Structure
The project consists of five phases, each focusing on different aspects of big data analysis.

### **Phase 1 - Introduction, Background, and Data Exploration**
- Introduction to the **Catch the Pink Flamingo** game and its dataset.
- The dataset consists of **eight CSV files** containing different types of game-related data.
- Hands-on data exploration, aggregation, and filtering using **Splunk**.

### **Phase 2 - Classification using Decision Trees**
- Implementing **classification models** on the game data.
- Using **KNIME** to build a **decision tree** for data classification.

### **Phase 3 - Clustering using Spark MLlib**
- Performing **cluster analysis** on game data.
- Utilizing **Apache Spark MLlib** for clustering tasks.

### **Phase 4 - Graph Analytics with Neo4j**
- Exploring **simulated chat data** from the game.
- Conducting **graph analytics** using **Neo4j**.

### **Phase 5 - Preparing Final Presentation & Report**
- Summarizing and interpreting findings from previous weeks.
- Creating a presentation and report on the results.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Splunk** (Data exploration & filtering)
- **KNIME** (Decision tree classification)
- **Apache Spark MLlib** (Clustering)
- **Neo4j** (Graph analytics)

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of **8 separate CSV files** that simulate various in-game user activities and interactions. These files include:
- Player actions
- Game session logs
- Chat logs
- In-game purchases

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this  project, I have acquired the following skills:
- Gain hands-on experience in **big data analytics**.
- Develop skills in **data exploration, classification, clustering, and graph analytics**.
- Learn to use industry-standard tools like **Splunk, KNIME, Apache Spark, and Neo4j**.
- Successfully analyze large-scale datasets and generate actionable insights.
